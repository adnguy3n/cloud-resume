    <h1>Cloud Resume Challenge</h1>
    <section>
        <p>While looking for ideas for a personal project, the Cloud Resume Challenge is one I often come cross. While I have yet to acquire an cloud certification, I figured why not do the project first and just add the certification when I get it. After all, the important part is learning and I tend to learn better by simply doing something.</p>
